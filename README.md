Model to study surface condensation of 𝛼-synuclein on a lipid bilayer. The membrane is composed of two kinds of lipids (DOPC and DOPS) and is represented via a 2D Ising model (lipid-lipid interaction Jm). 𝛼-synuclein proteins are represented using a 3D lattice-gas model (protein-protein interaction Jp). The proteins interact with the membrane via tethers (protein-tether interaction Jt)


The custom code is written in Julia language (Version 1.10.9) and was exectued on a standard desktop (32 GB RAM, 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-12700) with Debian 12.11 operating system.
